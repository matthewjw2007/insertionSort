In order to use the site, download all three files into one folder and then open index.html with your browser. The user
then can enter 10 numbers to be sorted. This small app shows the use of the insertion sort algorithm and manipulation of the
DOM. After the 10 numbers are entered by the user the top submit button becomes inactive and a new one appears below the first
table that once clicked displays the values in a sorted order. This was made to practice using prototypes, manipulating the DOM,
and using the insertion sort algorithm.
